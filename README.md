The CNATool tool was developed, using the MaiaScript programming language, to allow quick and simplified analysis of graphs of complex networks, from any device connected to the Internet.

The complete documentation, including the EBNF grammar file and the compiler's
syntax diagrams (railroad diagrams), for MaiaScript, can be found in the grammar directory.

Currently the tool allows:

- Display network graph;
- Layout graph;
- Calculat basic properties: Average Grade, Density, Average Clustering - Coefficient, Average Shortest Path, Diameter and Graph Efficiency;
- Display detailed properties of the vertices: Degrees, Clustering, Centrality;
- Save graph in Pajek format;
- Export graph in SVG format;
- Save a summary of graphâ€™s properties in HTML format;
- Use the GPU when available.
